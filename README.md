Predict survival on the Titanic... Project from Kaggle

My first Kaggle project. The  objective was to predict wither a person survived or didn't survive the Titanic shipwreck. 

I used different Python libraries to clean, correct, and complete the data. Then I visualized the data to understand the correlation between different data features, then I implemented different models, which I evaluavted and tuned accordingly to achieve the highest accuracy.


Accuracy: 82%
